				.response__description When water strikes, every minute counts. Our Sydney-based technicians arrive within 90 minutes on average, stopping damage before it spreads and starting the recovery process immediately. Here's why speed matters: within the first 24 hours, water begins penetrating deeper into building materials, mould spores start to germinate, and structural damage accelerates. The faster we extract water and begin drying, the less damage occurs—which means lower costs and faster recovery for you. Our rapid response isn't just convenient—it's the difference between minor repairs and major renovation.
