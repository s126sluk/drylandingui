								.h5 Firstly, don’t panic, we’ve done this thousands of times and your in good hands. Where possible, relocate valuable items and furniture away from the affected area to prevent moisture absorption. Open windows to improve airflow where safe and practical to do so, but avoid using household fans as this can spread contaminants.

								.h5 In most cases, no. We use professional-grade equipment designed to work quietly and safely while you go about your day. If you encounter any situation where you think it is safer to temporarily relocate, you may wish to do so. Please keep us informed so we can coordinate our attendance whilst you are at home.

								.h5 Yes—and this is exactly why fast response matters. Mould can begin developing within 24-48 hours of water damage. Our fast response time and state of the art equipment capabilities are specifically designed to get moisture levels down before mould has a chance to take hold. However, you may have pre-existing mould or mould spores already developing, in this case water damage can exacerbate its growth and that’s why taking quick action is so important.

								.h5 Whilst we handle insurance claims daily and know exactly what documentation insurers need, we cannot look after your claim on your behalf. We can provide detailed reports, photos, and moisture readings, and we're happy to share these directly with your insurer to make the process as stress-free as possible.

								.h5 We work with renters regularly. Simply let your landlord or property manager know about the damage, and we can coordinate directly with them or their insurer. Your contents may be covered under your renters insurance—we can help document any personal items affected.
