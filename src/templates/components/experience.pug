				.experience__description Our team members bring several years of hands-on water damage experience, ensuring your home is in the care of true professionals. Unlike companies that use rotating contractors, our technicians are dedicated DrySafe team members who understand Sydney properties inside and out—from older terrace homes in Paddington to modern apartments in Chatswood. They know how water affects local building materials, how Sydney's humidity impacts drying times, and how to work efficiently within insurance requirements. This local expertise means faster, more effective recovery for your home.
